    "\n",
    "## Homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo called \"SYD_DAT_8\"\n",
    "<font color = red> GP - Repo is called DAT8SYD </font>\n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!)\n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",
    "* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n",
    "* Write a summary of 2 chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/) in Markdown in this notebook and commit it to your repository on github\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming\n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "  * Overview of your idea\n",
    "  * What data you will use\n",
    "  * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve\n",
    "  * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions: copy this file and append your name in the filename, e.g. Homework1_ian_hansel.ipynb.\n",
    "Then commit this in your local repository, push it to your github account so I can see your work. Remeber if you get stuck to look at the slides going over Git**\n"

    "## Analyzing the Analyzers Reading\n",
    "#### Short Summary\n",
    "* Harris, Murphy, Vaisman 2012; article and write up of a survey conducted on the DC \"analytics/data science/big data/applied stats/Machine Learning\" community with 250 respondants.\n",
    "* The problem this article and study was trying to address was the waste of time and resources in the industry due to a poor understanding of the diversity and skills within the workforce (i.e. attempting to hire a single developer to perform a \"Rockstar/God\" remit of work). \n",
    "* Respondants were asked to describe their background, skills and how they self identified. These results were submitted to \"cluster analysis\", to identify 4 skill and ID groupings, titled \"Data Businesspeople\", \"Data Creatives\", \"Data Developer\", and \"Data Researchers\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaways\n",
    "1. The study is problematic. <br>\n",
    "    *Sample size was low, storytelling got in the way of the results, and absence of parameters like \"Number of years in field\" along with focus on viral/social link sharing skewed the results.* \n",
    "2. Mosaic charts are money! <br>\n",
    "    *Colors are much more nicer than a stacked column with a legend!*\n",
    "3. The categories aren't bad ones to act on, and quick classification can be achieved using the T-skill model. <br>\n",
    "    *Can qualify a Data Business Person from a Data Researcher by asking whether their depth of skill is Biz vs Stats*\n",
    "4. Huge datasets were uncommon across all skillsets, supporting DS as a seperate and unique discipline to Big Data. <br>\n",
    "    *Though has this changed in the 5 years since 2012?*\n",
    "5. Qualify your hiring managers. <br>\n",
    "    *Candidates must protect themselves from \"Rockstar/God\" or \"apples vs oranges\" expectations.\n",

    "## Data Scientist Handbook 2 Chapter Summary\n",
    "> Selected chapters are:\n",
    "> * <font color=red> Michael Hochster, LinkedIN, \"The Importance of Developing Data Sense\" </font> <br>\n",
    "> * <font color=blue> Diane Wu, Palantir/MetaMind, \"The Interplay between Science, Engineering and Data Science\". </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=red> Michael Hochster </font>\n",
    "I chose this chapter due to the promised discussion of **data sense** - something I've built an appreciation of when being exposed to unfamiliar data sets at the Minerva Collective.\n",
    "Michael's thoughts on this mysterious quality came towards the end - and referenced Skomoroch's definition of Data Scientists into Type 1 and Type 2 (which I understand was used to build teams at LinkedIn). The reason you can't call a Type 1 \"Data Scientist\" a \"Statistician\" is because there is more to handling and wrangling data than most statisticians are ready to tackle. Data sense broke down to a way of thinking about a dataset that answers the following questions:\n",
    "* What should I compare?  \n",
    "* Whats the control? \n",
    "* How can I transform it to make it more reasonable? \n",
    "* What do I need to go away and find/measure?\n",
    "As for how to get it - Hochster cites a diverse and deep experience with data, but it essentially seems to be a knack. Darn. \n",
    "Thankfully, there was a more concrete payoff in the discussion of \"Metrics\" and how it's difficult to design and evaluate metrics (i.e. there's no metrics for metrics\". His method involves:\n",
    "* Coming up with something plausable (i.e. clicks vs percieved value of result)\n",
    "* Think up circumstances where it would point in the opposite direction.\n",
    "* Identify cases of these circumstances.\n",
    "* Impose segmentation to avoid these circumstances/noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=blue> Diane Wu </font>\n",
    "I chose this chapter due to my familiarity with Metamind, and Diane's academic background.\n",
    "Her chapter discussed the following concepts:\n",
    "1. Data science has an umbrella definition, and a lot of roles have difficulty defining success (i.e. not everybody can entirely measure success on the accuracy of their predicted models).\n",
    "2. The T-shape model for skills and specialization, where one should have lots of breadth and find the one area to add more depth.\n",
    "3. Her Data science process, where she \n",
    "    * identifies an Actionable goal or desired insight. <br>\n",
    "    * Evaluates the Form, scale, reliability, availability of data\n",
    "    * Builds the ML algorithms. \n",
    "    * Iterate.\n",
    "4. How computers and humans can form a **symbiosis**, where **computers** crunch the models, and **humans** interpret the patterns to make accountable decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concept involved the balance of scientific and engineering mentality. Almost always, with real world problems, there is no time to ask why and figure everything out before executing, and you often have to act with incomplete knowledge. As such, a candidate needs to be able to think like an engineer. However, engineering without data science is like building a bridge without ever fail testing it. There is a delicate balance to be struck. \n",
